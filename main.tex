\subsection{Abstract}
Ice is well known for its ability to entrap microbial life and biomolecules, and it provides a record physical history within its stratigraphy. Thus, in the search for life or its components on ice covered ocean worlds such as Europa or Enceladus, it is crucial to be able to take ice core samples with reliability and to preserve the stratigraphy of the samples for later analysis. Our design fulfills the device requirements with 3 sample containers each with their own ice drill, which will extend outside the submerged rover to retrieve the ice samples. We will utilize a hollow drill with a heated tip to allow easier drilling into the ice, and
