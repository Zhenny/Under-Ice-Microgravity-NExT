\subsection{Abstract}

\subsection{Test Objectives}

\subsubsection{Device Design}
This section will include a piece by piece, part by part description of our device with equations, drawings, materials, and measurements

\subsubsection{Additional Design Considerations}
This section will include any discrepancies between our NBL conditions and design and a real Europa design.

\subsubsection{Requirement Compliance Matrix}
\begin{center}
    \begin{tabulary}{\linewidth}{|L|L|}
    \hline
    Objectives & Method \\
    \hline
    The device shall collect cylindrical samples 0.5" in diameter and 3" deep. &
    Each sheath will have 0.5" in diameter and 3" deep \\
    \hline
    The device shall collect, seal, and store at least 1 sample. &
    The device store each sample in its own sheath within each drill \\
    \hline
    The device shall obtain a subsurface sample from solid and slushy ice. &
    The device will cut using a thermal coring drill \\
    \hline
    The device shall minimize cross contamination between samples. &
    Each sample will be in it's own cutting device preventing contamination between samples \\
    \hline
    The device shall minimize cross contamination by air or water once obtained. &
    The device will use psi to push the drill out and in the process keeping water out \\
    \hline
    The device can be operated electrically by no more than 12V. Power to be supplied by the NBL only. &
    The device will run on a micro-controller \\
    \hline
    The device can have multiple parts that can attach and detach &
    The device's drill will move on it's own separate from the frame \\
    \hline
    The device (all parts, in stowed configuration) shall fit within a 3" diameter x 6" long cylinder. &
    The device's design will fit within a 3" diameter x 6" long cylinder \\
    \hline
    The device (all parts) shall have a dry weight less than 5 lbs. &
    The device's weight will be 4.5 lbs\\
    \hline
    The device (all parts) shall operate underwater with provided electrical power &
    The device will have several parts that will not allow water in and even in failure will be water resistant \\
    \hline
    The device shall be commanded via general purpose input/output lines (3.3V or 5V compatible), or via a Universal Asynchronous Receiver/ Transmitter (UART-3.3V/5V). & 
    The device will run on a simple DC circuit\\
    \hline
    The device shall be compatible with a chlorine water environment and a salt-water environment. & 
    Te thermal drills will cut ice in both environments.\\
    \hline
    The device shall operate within an environment from -5$^\circ$C to 30$^\circ$C. &
    The components will be insulated to protect from environments. \\
    \hline

\subsubsection{Additional Desires Compliance Matrix}
\begin{center}
    \begin{tabulary}{\linewidth}{|L|L|}
    \hline
    Objectives & Method \\
    \hline
    The device shall be able to collect, seal, and store at least 3 samples. &
    The device will have 3 thermal drills along with 3 sheaths to collect ice samples. \\
    \hline
    The device shall maintain the stratigraphy of the sample during collection, containment, and transportation. The sample shall not melt. &
    The ice will be insulated in sheaths to maintain it's current temperature for as long as the drill process proceeds and then a fridge will continue the cooling after drilling. \\
    \hline
    The device shall allow for removal of samples for verification that the stratigraphy is maintained &
    The sheaths can be open from the side to allow removal of the ice easily. \\
